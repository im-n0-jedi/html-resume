    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        For my "Writing in Digital Environments" capstone, I acted as a Digital Consultant to analyze and redesign the university's student portal. 
        The project aimed to shift the design philosophy from a dated, database-style list to a modern "Zero Click" dashboard. 
        I created a card-based interface that prioritizes high-frequency tasks—such as viewing grades, financial aid status, and course schedules—ensuring actionable data is immediately visible without requiring deep navigation.
