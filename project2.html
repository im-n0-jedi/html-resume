    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        I designed and deployed a dedicated home server by repurposing legacy PC hardware, installing and configuring the TrueNAS Scale operating system. 
        This project involved setting up a ZFS-based storage pool ("tank") for data integrity, configuring network interfaces for reliable access, and managing system resources including ECC memory and CPU usage. 
        The server now serves as a central hub for media streaming and secure file storage, managed through a web-based dashboard.
